* 2-3 tree
    * adaptation of BST
    * allow for 2 keys per node (2 keys, 3 children)
    * maintain symmetric order and perfect balance
    
* red black BSTs
    * represent 2-3 tree as a BST
    * use internal left-leaning links as "glue" for 3-nodes
    
    
* intersections among geometric objects. applications: games, movies, databases...
* efficient solutions: BSTs   
* 1d range search
    * extension of ordered symbol 
    * insert key-value pair
    * range search, range count
    * geometric interpretation
    * ordered array: range count and range search become log N
    
* line segment intersection
    * given N horizontal and vertical line segments, find all intersections
    * naive: quadratic algorithm
    * sweep-line algorithms: sweep vertical line from left to right: N * log N; recudes 2d search to 1d
* Kd trees
    * extension of ordered symbol table to 2d keys
    * clustering: when points not evenly distributed; grid implementation is not good for it
    * use a tree to represent a recursive subdivision of 2d space
    * 2d tree construction: recursively partition plane into two halfplanes
    * boids
    * n-body simulation
