##Lecture 2: core elements of programs
* programming languages: syntax and semantics

* low level languages: source code -> checker -> interpreter -> ouput. source code very similar to internal control unit. at the level of macine

* high level languages: source code -> checker -> compiler -> object code -> interpreter -> output. higher abstractions. 
* tradeoffs: compiled languages are usually faster. hard to debug. interpretive languages: slower, easier to debug. 
* program: a sequence of definitions and commands
* data objects: programs can manipulate. each object has a type that defines the kinds of things programs can do to it: scalar, non-scalar. 
* scalar objects: int, float, bool
* expressions: objects and operators, each of which denotes an object of some type. example: i + j
* order of computations: parentheses, operator precedence
* type conversions: float(3)
* simple means of abstraction: assignment. radius = 11.2
* non-scalar objects (compound objects): strings (str). 
* operator overloading: let operator decide what types of object it's dealing with
* branching programs: conditional
* programs that run constant time: the time it is run depends on the length
