MITx: 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python

##Lecture 1: introduction to computation
* goal: 1. solve problems in algorithmic or mechanic manners; 2. learn computational modes of thinking
* computers: perform primitive calculations; remember the results (fast, large)
simple calculations (brute force) are not enough (slow web searching example)
limits: too complex (weather predicting) , or fundamentally impossible (Turing's Haling problem)
* what's computation? 
	* 2 types of knowledge (declarative, imperative i.e. how-tos)
	* algorithms are recipes (test, calculate, flow of control)

* how to capture a recipe in a mechanical process: 
	1. fixed program computers (early computers); 
	2. stored program computers (modern computers)

* stored program computer: sequence of instructions(programs) stored inside computer (built from predefined set of primitive instructions);
* interpreter executes each program in order
a basic machine architecture basic primitives: Turing shows 6 primitives can compute anything (Turing complete); modern programming languages have a more convenient set of primitives

* programming languages: a set of primitives; legal expressions, deduce their meanings

* aspects of languages: 
	1. primitive constructs; 
	2. syntax; 
	3. static semantics (2.3/'abc'); 
	4. semantics 
	
* errors: syntactic errors; static semantics error; unintended meaning (crashes, infinite loop, .etc)
