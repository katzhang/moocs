##Views

* three-level vision of database: physical, conceptual, logical
* why use views?
	* hide some data from some users
	* make some queries easier/more natural
	* modularity of database access
* real applications tend to use lots of views

* define a view: view V = ViewQuery(R1, R2, ...), V acting like a temporary table
