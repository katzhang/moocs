##Querying XML

* querying XML not nearly as mature as querying relational databases
* XPath
	* think of XML as a tree
	* XPath = path expressions + conditions
	* basic constructs:
		* slath: / : root, separator
		* X, * 
		* @: match an attribute
		* //: any descendant of current element
	* built-in functions: contains, name, .etc
	* navigation "axes": keyword to navgate
